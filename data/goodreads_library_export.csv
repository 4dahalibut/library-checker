My overall criticism of the genre is always that the science is not really science, but this book gets super close to having believeable science. It is chock full of amazing sciency-stuff, which is why it is so cool. It's ideas of consciousness are fairly groundbreaking, and the end section really gets to my nerd sensitivities. However, this book falls apart with its writing clarity completely, as many key examples of the science Watts must have worked so hard to think up are just very difficult to decipher. I also don't like the full nerd boner that Watt's has for himself. He could back off the pretentiousness slightly. <br/><br/>Despite giving this book a 4, of course it is still one of my favorite books just for its amazingly originial take on consciousness and what unconscious beings would be like.

Theda is very convincing in making sure everybody agrees about the trajectory of voluntary associations, why they became prevalent, what replaced them, and why they died. <br/><br/>They died because of racial / gender integration (which these associations vehemently opposed, against the wishes of the younger generation), a movement of political leverage into DC from the states and localities, a growing disinterest in patriotism, an replacement of civic acts for self improvement to mostly being used for advocacy. etc. <br/><br/>They grew and spread as people moved around to new areas of the USA, and as the kind of glue that held otherwise atomized units of people together. People love hanging out. <br/><br/>On the activism side, these groups were replaced by groups like EDF or NAACP, or AARP which are ""professional"" ""advocacy"" institutions that mostly communicate with members thru mail. <br/><br/>Voluntary associations tended to meet in their one place, and act as a federalist democracy, in a kind of cloned format of the national democracy. They had lots of elections, and did things like dinners, and drills, and reading groups and stuff. However, one of the points that I didn't really understand about these groups, was what activities they ""really"" were built around. Like what did the Elks ""do"" mostly? Was it converse? hold elections for things? what were they voting on? <br/><br/>Then the other issue I came away confused about was like, ok Skocpol makes it clear that the voluntary associations had leverage over every level of politics in the USA. Was it primarily through having senators as members of the associations? Was it through elections and then just voting, given their huge numbers? Unclear. <br/><br/>Generally, it seems really great to maybe restart a group cohesion where lots of like-minded people get together regularly, to discuss civic matters in a dignified manner, and to pursue the furtherment of virtues in each of their lives. The book does not give a great pattern to follow to bring these back though! <br/><br/>The closest thing in my life that I have similar to this are Effective Altruism Movement, and Fractal. <br/><br/>EA is different in myriad ways to a voluntary association - it's global primarily instead of national, there aren't really associational meetings for general purposes, instead there are meetings held to further specific directions of inquiry. The main glut of the association is now online instead of in person. <br/><br/>If I were to take EA and move it one step further towards being something like the Masons, I would say I could attend and pursue getting others to attend regular meetings, with elections on some sort, and debates about those elections.<br/><br/>EDIT: Now that I actually finished the book, upgrading to a 5. It's rare to see a book describe a problem so thoroughly and then give a good perspective on how to form a solution. Theda talks about 2 salient points I would like to reflect here. <br/><br/>Instead of polls, politicians and the media should lean more on people who have a reasonable claim to represent a body of the politic. Since Theda wrote this, elite opinion has turned even further away from polling. <br/><br/>There are certain laws that prohibit associations from flying too close to overtly political actions. Skocpol says we should rid ourselves of these. <br/><br/>Skocpol hammers home how if we don't re-align elite thrusts of politics with the ordinary man's desires, we're going to be worsening the gap between what our populace wants to see in politics and what actually happens. One harmful outcome of this, is that often the two parties will argue over a trivial matter that doesn't directly affect people's lives, while leaving important issues untouched that are more directly relevant. This happens because enfrothening the masses through hot button issues gets them to donate more, but these aren't the issues that will come out of a healthier representation. <br/><br/>Link to a ""prospectus"" of the book https://prospect.org/special-report/narrowing-civic-life/<br/><br/>I was tempted into reading this by Tanner Greer, who I'm a huge fanboi of https://scholars-stage.org/pining-for-democracy-a-few-readings/",,,1,0

He kind of slaps the reader over the head with this theme, that humanity needs to be more like his race of alien spiders which still quarrels and kills eachother, but at the end of the day would rather help another species than kill it off. <br/><br/>The minus 1 star, is for a slightly over the top caricaturization of humanities flaws, and I'm not exactly sure he even gets them right. <br/><br/>Tchaikovsky says our biggest flaws, the ones that will doom us, are unempathetic utilitarianism. However, if anything has proven out over time, it's that what will doom us are coordination problems. Maybe some higher amount of empathy for others than humanity posesses solves coordination problems. In the book, the humans decide to attempt to kill off all the spiders because of the ""prisoners dilemma"" which only holds under conditions that the prisoners cannot talk to eachother, and Adrian is then all like, ""but the spiders actually believe that the coordination is the way out of the prisoners dilemma lmao"". Which, like yes but also humans would agree on that. <br/><br/>The strong points of the book were readability, amazing worldbuilding for the spiders, great AI fusion character, like way better than average. Adrian is always ready to punish a character, which I fuckin love, two characters that are punished like, harder than most other stuff besides Hyperion, are punished because they attempt to upload their consciousnesses. Which like, yass Adrian fuckin teach em. <br/><br/>Anyways, back to the spiders. The parts of the book with the spiders were the better bits. They holy moly, they train ants to act as computers, and then embed an alien consciousness in the ant computer. <br/><br/>The stuff these spiders do with ants is unreal. Adrian had so much fun, and you will too, reading about what the spiders do with these ants. <br/><br/>Anyways, I would likely continue reading this series at some other time, but until then I've got other scifi to read. <br/><br/>Besides being an absolute romp, the lesson I'm taking away from the book is I gotta do more empathy thing. This is compounded by co-reading with ""The master and his emissary"" which talks about humans losing intuition, and a review of Caro's biography on Johnson, which talks about how his empathy was necessary for his power. I'm sure I'm taking the right lesssons here. Power is a very left brained thing anyways. I swewar I'm not trying to gain power, just trying to help us not all get killed. Pwomise. ",,,1,0

Thiel isn’t so solid on his gross cultural analysis, but paints a simple believable picture on what it takes to get ahead in this world, and it feels achievable on scales more than just the PayPal or the Facebook. He also extends his advice for creating startups to what it should look like to invest or to try to become employed in a successful vc backed hyper growth startup. Another bit I liked was treating yourself and everybody else as salespeople. A lot of this advice is probably diffused somewhat into the lexicon since this book came out, but I hadn’t had it presented to me directly. Also, the book is short, so that’s a plus, no wasted time, and it also gives insight into the mysterious thiel’s psyche, which I definitely was curious about coming into reading this. <br/><br/>",,,1,0

The book follows three generations of a family through the singularity (and their AI cat), and writes of the heroic actions they try to take to steer the future in a sane direction. <br/><br/>I thought that the first and third chapters were the strongest speculation. The first chapter explores what life would be like if we start offloading chunks of our psyche onto computers, such as processing, memory retrieval, etc. <br/><br/>The second part follows a lil space ship of digital people who were cloned from real people, on their way to make first contact with some alien ""router"". This part introduces the idea of cloning bits of yourself to do temporary processing which is neat. <br/><br/>The third part explores these AIs who have gone completely alien and incomprehensible, and our turning the planets into computers. Humanity is managing to continue to eek out an existence on balloons floating in saturns atmosphere, and they're trying to figure out where they can go so that they won't get turned into computers themselves. (computer computer). In this bit, people regularly are uploaded, downloaded, people make clones of themselves, the protagonist from the first part becomes a flock of pigeons (hell yes) etc. <br/><br/>If I'm reading scifi, I like it to be hard, otherwise, I'll just read actual literature. This certainly satisfies my desire to read an exploration of what happens if we really lean into the whole AI stuff. <br/><br/>Now that LLMs are a thing, we'll start to get to a place where at least the first bit of stuff in part 1 is possible. I definitely predict that in the next year or two, people will start offloading significant processing and memories into computers. I could see Stross's reading of the future actually coming true further than this in broad strokes, with humans living next to completely alien AIs, and digital people. To me, this could be considered dystopian. It's fun to read about, but I'd rather live in a normal ish seeming world than the scifi future painted in this book. <br/><br/>",,,1,0
25353286,Provenance (Imperial Radch),Ann Leckie,"Leckie, Ann",,"=""""","=""""",3,3.84,Orbit,ebook,481,2017,2017,,2023/05/04,,,read,"Recommended for me by Petrichor :) <br/><br/>First book I read on my time on the boat. Read it all before we left panama. <br/><br/>First of all, the positives. The plot was tight. Each part of the work flowed well from the last, and it felt like the protagonist (named Ingray) was pulled along for the ride, choosing the heroic action every time. <br/><br/>The worldbuilding was developed. The different civilizations and aliens felt like we were learning about a small part of a larger story, only being informed of the important details. <br/><br/>The best part: the protagonist, Ingray, was written in a special way. Ingray was painted as a very emotions driven *woman* with a lot of heart, who cared deeply for her friends and had a deep sense of right and wrong. Funnily enough, the woman who recommended the book to me is a doppelganger of the protagonist. Ingray managed herself in a distinct way, where she would know that if she wasn't in full control of e.g. her breathing, she would break down and cry. This characterization was repeated a bit ad nauseum for me, but I firstly was impressed with the fact that this is actually how some people (women) feel emotions, and secondly that this might be hugely resonating for a woman that is in fact this sort of person.  I loved it because the attributes of this character deeply determined her responses and actions in the situations that Leckie placed her in; the novel could even be thought of as a study on this sort of personality. <br/><br/>ANYWAYS the bad. <br/><br/>Serbat this, serbat that, how many times can. you mention how amazing a fictional beverage tastes before leaning on other apercus? Grating. <br/><br/>The climax of the novel was this tiny little contrived situation, where there were two attackers from another civilization who Ingray sort of just, hung out with for a while and tried to outmaneuver. Given the whole book involved Ingray meeting with aliens nobody has ever seen before, and starts with her resuscitating a man from the dead, the climax was such a littler event in the grand scheme  of things than might be expected from a climax. I in fact don't necessarily fault Leckie for not introducing a more explosive climax, but I do fault her with the kind of drawn out, milquetoastness of it. <br/><br/>The aliens weren't *that* alien. I like my aliens to be alien. <br/><br/>Lastly, Ingray's brother named Danach, of course I identified with a bit. He existed to be the books real enemy and foil for Ingray, a conniving lil guy who exists to be bested and belittled, but being a lil guy myself and seeing how the entire book set him up to take the fall, I couldn't help but feel for him, even though in the denouement, Leckie has Ingray do the pretty much only cold-hearted act of the whole book, where Ingray heroically just like, kind of doesn't have time for him. Which is fine, but I felt for Danach for sure. <br/><br/>Anyways, generally I thought the book was a bit thin and straightforward, besides the unique characterization of Ingray, which was very interesting. However, knowing people like Ingray gets you all the benefits of reading a book about them fortunately for me. ",,,1,0

""Formal order is always parasitic on informal processes"". By trying to replace indiginous folk knowledge with imperial scientific knowledge, the workings of any system were made significantly worse. I find an analogue between scientific knowledge vs folk knowledge, and analytical vs intuitive reasoning, however the more I think about it, the more the differences start to become overbearing. <br/><br/>Seeing like a state has been used for justification towards placing more priors in knowledge not proven. This is good. There are other recent thought-pieces which have been used as justification for reasoning intuitively vs analytically. This is also good. Lots of the same people default to using one to justify the other, me too as of a few weeks ago, and this is not good and not valid. <br/><br/>A closer comparison, which the book itself makes, is between scientific knowledge and observation, vs metis and experience. This is also close to analysis vs intuition, and flirts with it heavily, but is a different concept. For example, Scott talks about how wrestling is a discipline laden with experiential knowledge. This is true, however, I would say that wrestling can be extremely analytical as well, at least when it comes to Jiu Jitsu. <br/><br/>These concepts are easy to confuse, and I think more subtlty could even be demanded of the author. The author notes, correctly I think, that experiential knowledge is harder to codify. However, I don't think this is because of inherent complexity, as much as the fact that codifying some things, e.g. data, pictures, words, is easier than codifying other things, such as tones, feelings, and bodily sensations. <br/><br/>Notably, I don't think that this makes the latter more *complex* than the former! I just think it's more resistant of society's understanding because us people in the west are so confined to learning things through codified pathways. When I say the book needs more subtlety, I mean this because other examples the author uses *are* indicative of intuition necessitated complexity, such as the forestry examples. <br/><br/>One other thing I enjoyed about the book is a distinction between knowledge that helps in a single specific event and knowledge that helps in general across a distribution of events. I think I've personally been liable to think too much about the distribution, and less about specific events, which belies my observational-knowledge tendencies. <br/><br/>This honestly is something I've been needing to hear, that it is necessarily to make every single instance of a thing excellent during the completion of the individual thing, than trying to make the general action of the thing excellent.

I think they spend most of the book on this ship traveling to meet aliens, which seemed like it was character building, and then they meet the aliens for the climax, and its the same aliens as before, and the action scenes are fractured and hard to follow, and I didn't find myself enthralled or cheering for the characters. <br/><br/>First book was one of my favorites so this is for sure a letdown.

He uses his new theory of the artificial to exploring his research on the internal environment of the human brain, and how it makes decisions, as well as the economy, and government. <br/><br/>The book includes a window into the research going on in Simon's cohort in the 1960s, from computational brain models such as SOAR, to chess playing bots, to highway planners, to theses on management decision-making. Simon draws on these papers to find the underlying constants that tie the common attributes of the systems together, such as the structure as hierarchical or almost-hierarchical. This is a mix of obvious and misleading. I would say that taking such a fundamental view on systems will give us profound ideas only if we can see them, it will show us obvious ideas which were non-obvious at the time, and will show us gaps in our thought that might be good candidates for exploration. One of these is a learning system which can search a tree of concepts MCTS style but applies an idea learned on one leaf immediately to other leaves which might contain similar ideas. Basically, an MCTS which tries to learn and apply patterns. <br/><br/>I'm really happy I discovered this, because it launched my exploration of design as a field. ",,,1,0

The author wrote the book not knowing russian, which is absolutely silly, but whatever. We hear from a woman having a baby, a planner figuring out how to plan the economy, a couple fighting hard to be prototypical soviets, a ""reverse salesman"" etc. <br/>Some lessons I learned from the book:<br/><br/>I have had a hard time in my life really understanding what it's like to fear being candid with the people around you. In Russia, you could easily be sent to the gulag for a wayward sentence or note. It seems that in such a society, this fear tramples the innocence of innocence, leading to a layer of surliness over top of confidences, ecstasy, and dreams. Of course in many stories the anger and hopelessness shone through, and of course now that I have read it, the absolute complexity and inertia of the soviet machine maps very closely to the complexity I see inside of Amazon. This last bit was very interesting to read and see the parallels. An example of this is that although Kosygin had in his hands a better economic planning protocol, he chose a stable decline over it because he felt that if the algorithms broke the economy, this unknown would be unmanageable compared to top down bureaucratic decisions. This maps very neatly with neural networks inside of large scale machine learning systems. Although they are far more powerful, managers can be loathe to use them, because you can't make them do exactly what you want, or hold a single part accountable for a failure. With FST's and rules, you can easily add or subtract logic, but not so for an end to end system. <br/><br/>Another surprising fact was the underpinnings of hope which drove the early Soviet revolution, say in the 1950's. The people really believed that they could ""win"" and that the plenty that Stalin and Khrushchev promised would come, the utopia would arrive. This led to, according to the author, much of the pain in the early days which should have existed in people's hearts get punted towards the future, but when this pain landed in Kosygin's declining society, there was some hell to pay for sure. <br/><br/>Another self evident point that nevertheless was important to see in words, was the russian envy toward the West. The governments used the West as a sort of ruler to measure themselves on. <br/><br/>One issue I'm surprised the book didn't deal with was the nuclear terror. I read watchmen during reading this book, and Watchmen was all about the terror felt in America over being bombed, but this subject was just not breached in Red Plenty. I guess this makes sense, the book definitely chose its battles. ",,,1,0

I'll always remember the pirate subplot for its shameless pungency of the art and the violence. It really felt maximally brutal, without going (too much) over the top with it. This may be because for these subplots, it was spliced in with some kid sitting on a stump next to a newspaper salesman, so one didn't feel the full brunt of the evil displayed in the subplot. There may have been a metaphor here, something related to the everyday evil alongside the everyday normality? Not really sure. <br/><br/>One thing which perplexes me is that contrasted to the pirate subplot, Rorschach's violence completely paled. The child killer was glossed over almost completely, the dead dog was not displayed with the same sort of ugliness as the dead men made into a raft. I'm not really sure why the author made this choice. <br/><br/>I guess another aspect which the novel did well, but not enough to completely set itself apart in this regard, is how the author captured the consciousness of cold-war USA, with the always-on fear of MAD in people's minds. This was done well, the world felt sticky and anxious at all times, I may say even uniquely well. Each character's fights were contextualized to themselves and to us within this fear. The superhero's couldn't focus on the small time crime with the existential threat above them, the newspaper salesman let the fear provoke him into anger, but also found cause in it to display kindness. For Nite Owl,  it sort of was the reason he was a superhero in the first place. <br/><br/>One concept which I have no idea how to set in with the rest of the plot is the evil giant monster towards the end. The monster seems to be the idea of some ultimately evil force, meant to set the world's mind straight about its bickering, but this doesn't feel like a big enough conceptual finish to such a nicely refined book. The ending, despite its beautiful graphics, felt very anti-climactic, and didn't tie the concepts from the rest of the book together in my opinion. <br/>",,,1,0

I felt like it never dropped the bomb on me that I wanted though. It was very wes-andersoney, characters seemed like they were doing these irrational, beautiful, personable acts because the author wanted to make a statement, but I think these characters were just here to bounce around and around, flop around on the pages for a bit. One tidbit that stood out for me was the warmth of the male bonding. Apparently, Indonesians have better friends than I do, something that became evident multiple times through out the book.

These folks died for the quest, they went through hardships with a smile on their faces which were constantly degrading their bodies and threatening death. The commentary on ideal communities for actually getting shit done in the face of extreme hardship is the main draw. <br/><br/>The commentary spelled out, time out from reading about 2 months, drinks consumed 1.5. They had such high opinions of eachother. They wanted to do it for eachother, to prove to eachother that they could, more than to prove to themselves that they could. Being a worthwhile part of a great group, earning the respect of a great leader. <br/><br/>I would drop my life in a heartbeat to go on that sort of adventure. <br/><br/>I currently feel far too comfortable and contented to work myself that hard, and thats something I really don't want. Cherry happily breached his limits, and in the quest for a few penguin eggs. I like to think I'm the same sort of man. An instagrammer once said something along the lines of ""Half the fun in life is the act of pushing yourself, the other half is the view"". That instagrammer was kind of a douche, but I completely buy that statement. <br/><br/>Can I find something as beautiful and terrifying to try for as a trek across the winter antarctic coast, in search of penguin eggs? <br/><br/>I'll tell you in 40 years.

Here are some very shallow attempts at connexion with things I know. The madness of the story was captivating, coming on heavy at the beginning, and lightening lightly as the story went on. The intertwining of the narrator and the girl, and the narrator and the warden was so incredibly difficult, dynamic and realistic, casting light onto emotions which are at the edge of many of our worlds from about a mile away from the edge. The ice coming in was interminable, the pace and fear constant, which was beautiful, the franticness of the characters was justified and not overplayed. This was a work of poetry and of human relation more than technology. <br/><br/>I want to be able to find motifs, and there were, but naming them or analyzing the story too deeply is something which I want to confine to my thoughts, if just because this story is meant to be a mystery. Read the end nice and carefully. ",,,1,0

I also skipped the equivalent of 2 chapters towards the end. I half read this to prove to myself that I could still finish giant nonfiction books, and half because it was damn interesting. My purpose for reading it was to find insight into how Nazis made decisions and justified them, and I think this goal was not a perfect fit for this book. The initial chapters on Hitler's initial rise were certainly eye opening, but I read those so long ago I barely remember the content. The majority of the book is a surprisingly surface-deep overview of the logistics of the war. I really wish it skipped slightly over being fully comprehensive of every little happening of the war and explored a bunch of actions more fully, but that was obviously not this books aim. I rated it a 4/5 stars because it excels at what it is, which is being the definitive overview of the entire war, however for my uses I wish I had read something different. The first third of the book is definitely the best part, as it focuses on specific people the most. ",,,1,0

What was mildly disappointing in this book as well was that Egan himself didn't believe his concept for the self perpetuating universe was possible, and deliberately hand-waved over the main reason why it was not. Still very fun. <br/><br/>If you want the basic ideas, theres a good essay by Moravec called Consciousness, Existence, and Something Else which I can't Remember. That essay is truly a mindbender.",,,1,0

The themes themselves were wonderful no doubt, but the entire plot left me wanting for a more mature writer's take. The climax was weirdly both straightfoward and confusing, unfortunately, as things fell into place as one thought they would, but in a hard to keep track of way. It was the sort of novel where the author knew the premise, and knew where she wanted to get to, and kind of filled in the rest as she went along. <br/><br/>That said, wow were the concepts in the book amazing. The millenium-living creatures were a fascinating thought experiment, the genderless norms were unique, if a little forced and overplayed, and the ancillary concept was played well, the author considering, where it helped her, exactly what an almost-human might do in a given situation. <br/><br/>All in all, this book was a 5/5 concepts, 2/5 plot, and 2/5 characterizations.
